					<h1>Here's our cookies policy:</h1>
					<p>Please choose whether this site may use cookies or related technologies such as web beacons, pixel tags,
						and Flash object (“Cookies”). You can learn more about how this site uses Cookies and how your personal data
						may be processed by managing your settings and reading our privacy policy.

						Your choices on this site will be applied globally. You can change your mind and revisit your preferences at
						any time by accessing the "Cookie Preferences" link in the footer of this site.

						WE AND OUR PARTNERS
						We and our partners: process personal data such as IP addresses, unique IDs, browsing data for the purposes
						of: storing and/or accessing information on your device, serving you personalised ads, ad measurement,
						collecting audience insights, serving you personalised content, content measurement, using precise
						geolocation data, and actively scanning your device characteristics for identification.
						Cookies used for functionality allow users to interact with a service or site to access features that are
						fundamental to that service. Things considered fundamental to the service include preferences like the
						user’s choice of language, product optimizations that help maintain and improve a service, and maintaining
						information relating to a user’s session, such as the content of a shopping cart.

						Some cookies are used to maintain a user’s preferences. For example, most people who use Google services
						have a cookie called ‘NID’ in their browsers. This cookie contains a unique ID used to remember your
						preferences and other information such as your preferred language, how many search results you prefer to
						have shown on a results page (for example, 10 or 20), and whether you want to have Google’s SafeSearch
						filter turned on. Each NID cookie expires 6 months from a user’s last use. A cookie called
						‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ serves a similar purpose for YouTube and is also used to detect and resolve problems
						with the service.

						YouTube uses the ‘PREF’ cookie to store information such as a user’s preferred page configuration and
						playback preferences like autoplay, shuffle content, and player size. For YouTube Music, these preferences
						include volume, repeat mode, and autoplay. This cookie expires 8 months from a user’s last use.

						Some cookies are used to maintain and enhance a user’s experience during a specific browsing session. For
						example ‘YSC’ is used by YouTube to remember user input and associate a user’s actions. This cookie lasts
						for as long as the user keeps their browser open. The cookie ‘pm_sess’ also helps maintain a user’s browser
						session and lasts for 30 minutes.

						Some cookies improve the performance of Google services. For example, ‘CGIC’ improves the delivery of search
						results by autocompleting search queries based on a user’s initial input. This cookie lasts for 6 months.

						Security
						Cookies used for security authenticate users, prevent fraud, and protect users as they interact with a
						service.

						Some cookies are used to authenticate users, helping ensure that only the actual owner of an account can
						access that account. For example, cookies called ‘SID’ and ‘HSID’ contain digitally signed and encrypted
						records of a user’s Google Account ID and most recent sign-in time. The combination of these cookies allows
						us to block many types of attack, such as attempts to steal the content of forms submitted in Google
						services.

						Some cookies are used to prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. For example, the ‘pm_sess’ and ‘YSC’ cookies ensure
						that requests within a browsing session are made by the user and not by other sites. Both cookies prevent
						malicious sites acting without a user’s knowledge and as if they were that user.

						Analytics
						Cookies used for analytics help collect data that allows services to understand how users interact with a
						particular service. These insights allow services both to improve content and to build better features that
						improve the user’s experience.

						Some cookies help sites understand how their visitors engage with their properties. For example, Google
						Analytics, a Google product that helps site and app owners understand how people engage with a service, uses
						a set of cookies to collect information and report site usage statistics without personally identifying
						individual visitors to Google. ‘_ga’ is the main cookie used by Google Analytics. ‘_ga’ enables a service to
						distinguish one user from another and lasts for 2 years. It’s used by any site that implements Google
						Analytics, including Google services.

						Google services also use analytics cookies like these, as well as others like ‘NID’ on Google Search and
						‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ on YouTube.

						Advertising
						Google uses cookies for advertising, including serving and rendering ads, personalizing ads (depending on
						your ad settings at g.co/adsettings), limiting the number of times an ad is shown to a user, muting ads you
						have chosen to stop seeing, and measuring the effectiveness of ads. <i>We will install some programs that
							might cause your website to crash btw.</i>

						‘NID’ is used for these purposes to show Google ads in Google services for signed-out users
						‘IDE’ and ‘ANID’ are used for these purposes to show Google ads on non-Google sites
						Other Google services like YouTube may also use these cookies and cookies like ‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ to show
						more relevant ads.

						If you have personalized ads enabled, ‘ANID’ is used to remember this setting and lasts for 13 months in the
						European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK), and 24 months everywhere else. If
						you have disabled personalized ads, ‘ANID’ is used to store that setting until 2030. ‘NID’ expires 6 months
						from a user’s last use. ‘IDE’ lasts for 13 months in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK and 24 months
						everywhere else.

						Some cookies used for advertising are for users who sign in to use Google services. For example, ‘DSID’ is
						used to identify a signed-in user on non-Google sites and to remember whether the user has agreed to ad
						personalization. It lasts for 2 weeks.

						Through Google’s advertising platform, businesses can advertise in Google services as well as on non-Google
						sites that partner with Google.

						Some cookies support Google showing ads on third-party sites, and are set in the domain of the website you
						visit. For example, ‘_gads’ enables sites to show Google ads, including personalized ads. Cookies that start
						with ‘_gac_’ come from Google Analytics and are used by advertisers to measure user activity and the
						performance of their ad campaigns. The ‘_gads’ cookie lasts for 13 months and the ‘_gac_’ cookies last for
						90 days.

						Some cookies are used to measure ad and campaign performance and conversion rates for Google ads on a site
						you visit. For example, cookies that start with ‘_gcl_’ come from Google Analytics and are primarily used to
						help advertisers determine how many times users who click on their ads end up taking an action on their
						site, such as making a purchase. Cookies used for measuring conversion rates aren’t used to personalize ads.
						‘_gcl_’ cookies last for 90 days.

						Personalization
						Cookies used for personalization enhance the user’s experience by providing personalized content and
						features.

						Depending on your settings at g.co/privacytools, some cookies enable better recommendations within a
						service. For example, ‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ enables personalized recommendations on YouTube based on past
						views and searches. And ‘NID’ enables personalized autocomplete features in Search as users type search
						terms. These cookies expire 6 months after a user’s last use.
