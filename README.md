# It's You 

Project Name:

It’s You.

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

Our project mainly aims to break the fourth wall and shock the audience. The website displays our film titled “It’s You”. The plot is that the user of the website accepted all of the cookies and the privacy policy of the website without looking into what it actually was. We intentionally make the “cookies” button invisible to mimic the way the privacy policy is hidden in shady websites. This started a chain reaction of disasters: the website crashed, we started arguing among ourselves trying to figure out who sabotaged the website presentation. Finally, after everyone has been interrogated, we realize that the culprit has been the user of the website all along. This is when we break the fourth wall and put emphasis on being aware of the person using our website. In this way, we want to ensure a thrilling experience for our audience. Eventually, we want our audience to learn how to pay attention to these privacy policies before clicking Accept.

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?

Our wireframe basically consists of an intro page. In this page, the user is asked to either accept or decline the cookies our website uses for the optimal experience. Now, the word “cookies” on this page is also the button that when clicked takes the user to the cookies policy statement. Anyway, the user must accept the statement in order to proceed with the website. If the user Declines, a window alert pops up prompting the user to accept the statement. And, when the user accepts, the intro video is played for our film. After this video ends, the user has the option to interact with the website and choose whose interrogation they want to observe. After viewing all the interrogation videos, the user gets to choose who was the culprit. Having made this choice, the final video is played - followed by a little blooper. 

The background canvas we chose perfectly summarizes our theme - the interconnectedness of the past, present and future is depicted by the interactive dots that can join based on cursor movement. We used many overlays to include different parts of the site: popups for the videos etc. The special animations we made for the interrogation selection page rely on CSS animations (rotateX, rotateY etc.).

POSTPRODUCTION PARA HERE.

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

We are satisfied with how much we pushed ourselves creatively in this project: from the CSS animations to the storyline and post-production of our video. The end result was just what we envisioned right from the start, if not better.
